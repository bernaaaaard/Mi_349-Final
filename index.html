        <h2><b>What Reptile Should I get first?</b></h2>
        <aside><em>By Jonathan Grama &mdash; Posted - December 11th</em></aside>
        <article class="blogpost">
            <p>So, for our first OFFICIAL article, I am going to start where many reptile enthusiasts may also be starting when beginning their journey into the hobby! Now, there are a lot of reptiles, and most of them tend to be easier to take care of then your average dog or cat. Reptiles need to be fed much less often, do not require any affection, and often tend to excercize themself just fine, so not a lot of work is required for your average reptile compaired to a large mammalian pet, or even most smaller mammalian pets like rodents!<br></p>
            <p>This does not mean that Reptiles are braindead simple to take care of, however! Reptiles have special considerations such as heat and moisture requirements! And a quick way to kill your reptile is to forget to fill their water bowl, or to drop them from a high place! People who don't know how to take care of their reptile and just buy one to shut their kid up could kill them even easier then their dog or cat (RIP all the turtles sold to families during the last century), so we should establish a good starter reptile.<br></p>
            <p>Now, this might be a controversial take, but I happen to believe that snakes are <b>the</b> best first time reptile that anyone can get. They can't exactly run away from you, so if they escape and you find them, you can easily pick them up and put them in their enclosure again. They also need to eat the least out of all reptile groups. Many adult pet snakes typically go on diets where they are fed only 10 days at a time, so as long as their water bowl is full, you can leave your snake to theri own devices for that amount of time. And even if you need to be away for longer, some are even able to be left for months at a time without food (please research and consult your vet before you do this though, and it is generally not reccomended).<br></p>
            <p>So which snake is best to get? Well the most popular first snake seems to be the Ball Python, which makes sense. They have a nice temperment which lets you hold one without much fear and their humidity & heat requirements are quite easy to fulfill. But I'd like to offer another hot take and say a ball python is not the best first pet snake. Not because they are a bad choice, but because they aren't the best choice. The corn snake, my own type of snake, is a much easier snake to take care of for 2 main reasons.</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Humidity: Humidity can often be struggle for new reptile keepers, and you may not be ready to keep up with it if you have just gotten your first reptile. Corn Snakes live in hot, dry environments, meaning that humidity is not as much of a concern as it would be with other reptiles. You should still be aware of it, I maintain a wet hiding spot with moss that my snake can go in whenever they feel like, as well as a large water bowl and a bi-daily light sprits of water around his tank. But you definitely don't want to overdo it with corn snakes.</li>
                <li>Hunger: Snakes in general tend to have a reputation to be generally harder to feed than other reptiles because they tend to randomly not eat food they are given, especially if they are brumating, shedding, or stressed out. Ball Pythons are easy to stress out, and often this leads to them not wanting to eat often. Corn Snakes are amongst the more willing to eat. My own personal experience with my snake shows that no matter what, in one case even while he was just about to shed, my corn snake will nearly always want to eat, and this is typical with other corn snakes as well. </li>
             </ol>
             <p>With that, I hope I've convinced you that the perfect first reptile for beginners is a Corn Snake!</p>
